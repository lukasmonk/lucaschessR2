The format to create a persona file is a follows:

<Name of variable><space>=<space><value>

which is the same as:

<name> = <value>

for example:

PawnValueMg = 123
KnightValueEg = 321
KnightMobilityWt = 3

NOTE: There _must_ be a space between the = and the left and right sides

Any unmentioned term will have it's default value used.
The minimum and maximum values of each term are -10000 and +10000 respectively.
For ease of use, copy the 'default.txt' and modify the values as you please.

being worth more as the game progresses.

For example:
PawnValueMg - Value of pawn in the middle-game.
PawnValueEg - Value of pawn in the endgame.
Similarly for KnightValueMg, BishopValueEg etc...

                        * BishopValue(Mg/Eg)

PieceKingAtkWt - The weight of attacking each square near opponent's king with "Piece".
                 Each weight is added and sum is used to get the actual value from a table.
                 Should not be increased or decreased too much because it is exponential,
                 small changes in this will cause a huge change of actual playing style.
