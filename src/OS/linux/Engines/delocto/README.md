Delocto is a chess engine which can be used for playing chess games and analyzing chess positions.

## Features
Delocto is a traditional chess engine using an alpha-beta search algorithm. It uses many heuristics to enhance search and evaluation, many of which are inspired by other chess engines, most profoundly by Stockfish, Ethereal, Xiphos and Laser. Delocto is compliant with the UCI (Universal Chess Interface) protocol.

## Usage
Delocto is only a chess engine. This means it does not include a graphical user interface, just the logic for deciding which move to play in a given position. Check the manual of your preferred user interface to find out how to use it with Delocto.

## Goals
The primary goal of development is playing strength, although readability and style of the code is an important factor as well.
