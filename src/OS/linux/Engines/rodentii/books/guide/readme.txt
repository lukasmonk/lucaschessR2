These are guide books intended for use with Rodent II chess engine.
They should be used in conjunction with a main book (rodent.bin)
and are meant to guide the game stylistically.

active.bin - seeks dynamic positions, based on Kasparov's games without
QGD but with Benoni thrown in to stir things up.

empty.bin - empty book. Can be declared as a main book for weak personalities
if we want limited opening knowledge.

flank.bin - plays flank openings, likes fianchettoing bishops;
based on games by Tomasz Markowski with some lines added by hand.

kasparov.bin - Kasparov's games from PgnMentor as the firrst layer
+ 1980 to 2006 games as the second layer 
 
low.bin - minimal book which tries to start with a couple of moves that
do not reach the 4th or the 5th rank.

nimzowitsch.bin - Nimzowitsch's games form PgnMentor collection as the first layer 
+ pre-1930 games from Norm Pollock's collection as the second layer

petrosian.bin - Petrosian's games form PgnMentor collection as the first layer 
+ 1931 to 1980 games from Norm Pollock's collection as the second layer

solid.bin - Karpov + Uhlmann
