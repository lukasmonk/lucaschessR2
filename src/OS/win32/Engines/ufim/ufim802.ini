; This is a configuration file for Ufim 8.02.
; The "log" command works both in Winboard mode and in UCI mode.
; Other commands have influence on Winboard mode only (no effect in UCI mode).
; All commands should be in lowercase.
;
; For setting the size of the hash table, use (in lowercase) hashsize=X
; where X is an integer value in megabytes from 0 to 1023.
; For example, hashsize=64 means 64 megabytes of memory.
; The bigger is the hash size, the stronger is Ufim.
; The hash size must be only a part of the whole RAM of your computer,
; because Windows and Winboard need memory too.
; Too big hashsize causes frequent writing to your disk and weakens the program!
hashsize=0
;
; If you need a special log file for debugging, use log=1 (in lowercase).
; However, log=0 is recommended.
log=0
;
; If resign=1 then Ufim resigns in materially hopeless positions,
; but does not resign if it sees a forced checkmate.
; If resign=0 then Ufim never resigns.
resign=1
;
; If book=1 then Ufim uses the opening book (ufim802.bok).
; If book=0 then Ufim does not use books.
; However, ufim802.bok must be present even if it is not used.
book=1
;
; If learn=1 then Ufim can save some knowledge into the file ufim802.epd
; after every game. If learn=1 and hashsize>0 then Ufim can use
; the knowledge accumulated in previous games.
; If learn=0 then Ufim does not learn.
learn=1
;
; You can weaken Ufim by setting weak=n , where n is an integer from 1 to 50.
; Ufim blunders and plays more variously at weak levels.
; Weak levels are independent of your hardware, hashsize and time control.
; The weakest is weak=50, weak=49 is stronger etc.
; If you want to disable weak levels, use weak=0.
weak=0
;
; Weak levels do not need long calculations.
; However, humans prefer opponents thinking some time before moving.
; If weakdelay=0 then Ufim moves almost instantly on weak levels.
; If weakdelay=1 then Ufim delays its moves without additional calculations.
; Ufim does not delay the moves from its opening book in both cases.
weakdelay=1
