//HASHMEM :

Amyan will use this amount of MB of RAM for his hash tables, at least 1 MB.
More RAM is used for other stuff, but a small amount.

It is not always usefull to give it more and more RAM, because each time the effect of 
adding more and more ram is smaller and smaller, and perhaps even counterproductive.
For example in my celeron 1.3Ghz I have it at 32 mb and I don't change it unless the tc 
is at least G/30', but the truth is I am too lazy to test this well anyway.

X times longer time control or X times more computer speed, implies about X times more ram
could help.

Anyway, more cool than ram is the speed of your computer.


//BOOK :

Set 1 if amyan must use its small book, 0 if not.


//RENDITION :

Set 1 if amyan can resign a game(as a winboard engine), 0 if not.


//RENDITION MARGIN :

If amyan can resign, it will do it when it believes it is losing by X pawns units or more.


//FIXED SEARCH DEPTH :

If this is not zero, amyan will do searches to about this depth in half moves.
Aditional captures are seen anyway.


//OPPONNENT TYPE :

0 if it is human, 1 if computer, 2 if running under winboard or a gui that informs this to the engine.


//SAN :

If zero, amyan will use algebraic notation (e2e4 etc.), if 1 then amyan will use SAN (d4 Nf6 etc.)
The value 2 is for SAN in spanish.
This is for the pv shown under Winboard. Amyan won't understand san in console mode etc.


//evaluation stuff :

you can enter here numbers from 0 to 100. Each thingy belongs to the evaluations of 
positions in Amyan and you can give a number acording to the importance amyan must give to it.
For convenience, there are a few variables that are not affected by this settings.
