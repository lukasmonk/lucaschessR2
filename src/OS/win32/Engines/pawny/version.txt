* Version 0.2.1
Date started:  02.07.2010
Date released: 01.02.2011
	
  (Changes and notes)
  - Root search revisited:
    - applied LMR, check extension, Pawn Push extension and
    basically, the root node now looks almost identically to inner nodes.
  - New psq tables for white pawns, black pawns, white endgame pawns and black endgame pawns.
  - Several optimization and code cleanups.
  - PV displaying - if the principal variation from the triangular array is shorter than the depth passed,
    only then the pv is extracted from the transposition table.
  - Mate threat extension removed, instead mate_threat is used to restrict LMR and FP now.
	
  (Fixed Bugs)
  - Pawn hash table - Preventing the pawn pst value to enter in the table, since it's a
    dynamic value.
  - Mate in # displaying - corrected (STM perspective).


* Version 0.2
Date started:  16.06.2010
Date released: 01.07.2010

  (Changes and notes)  
  - New time control management scheme. 
  The time distribution formula was inspired by Tord Romstad
  from the early versions of Glaurung and achieves two goals:
  incomplete iterations are reduced to the minimum and
  time is distributed better between the moves. 
  No other changes. Difference in strength - only in matches.

* Version 0.1.9
Date started:  15.03.2010
Date released: 16.06.2010

  (Fixed Bugs)
  - Pawn push extension bug - fixed.
  - Bug in eval_white_passer - fixed.
  - 'Bad captures' ordering bug in main search - fixed.
  - Memory Alignment issues for Trans. And Pawn tables were fixed by writing own aligned allocation functions.

  (Changes and notes)  
  - New TT (4 entry buckets) + new replacement policy and better indexing.
  - Pawn Evaluation - rewritten. The array-fields was replaced by incrementally updated bitboards;
    Added couple of new pawn structure evaluation terms.
  - Removed couple of restrictions in IID.
  - Several optimizations (Splitting-up the mobility evaluation to omit piece-list loops, as well as several other minors).
  - Several code cleanups.


* Version 0.1.8
Date started:  03.03.2010
Date released: 15.03.2010

  (Fixed Bugs)
  - Recapture extension - removed entirely. Even after the proper implementation
    (without the found bug) of the idea, there was no noticeable benefit, so it was removed.

  (Changes and notes) 
  - Small optimization - Dynamic update of the material count, which relieves the evaluation of collecting it.
  - Maintenance release.

* Version 0.1.7
Date started:  15.02.2010
Date released: 02.03.2010

  (Fixed Bugs)
  - Reset Timer on Ponderhit conception was fixed. False by default.
  - Fixed Pondering to do infinite analysis until the stop command is received.

  (Changes and notes)
  - Evaluation:
    1. Added center control weights.
    2. Rook and Knights material imbalance tables.
    3. New (higher) Knight value.
    4. Added code for KBNK simple mate.
  - Movegen: New legal evasions generator.
  - Ordering: KxB and BxK are now considered as equal captures.
  - UCI option 'Ponder' added in order to invoke 'ponderhit' in GUIs (like Fritz 11) with no default support of it.
  - Better Polling.
  - Several code cleanups (like removing the annoying 'illegal position' hack from qsearch()).

* Version 0.1.6
Date started:  03.01.2010
Date released: 14.02.2010

  (Fixed Bugs)
  - Wrong calculation of the root moves count - fixed.

  (Changes and notes)
  - Polyglot book support added. 
  - New attack detection scheme.
  - SEE rewritten in accordance with the above.
  - Incremental update of the board state (material and pawns).
  - Main search and qsearch was revisited in order to eliminate some inaccuracies and errors.
  - Transposition table entry is being remade to 16 bytes of size.
  - Improved move ordering.

* Version 0.15
Date started:  10.12.2009
Date released: 01.01.2010

  (Fixed Bugs)
  - 'Reset Time On Ponderhit' command - fixed to work properly.
  - 1.5 seconds shorter time for the last move in x/x controls to avoid delay and eventual time-loss.

  (Changes and notes)
  - Reorganized move ordering.
  - 'òDynamic Time Control' is now added as UCI option. 
    It is a matter of preference to be turned off and it was designed
    to be stoppable mainly for human vs engine games. 
    Turning OFF that option would certainly affect the engine's strength (blitz mostly),
    but is still not enough tested to be clear how much exactly. 
    The default parameter is 'true', because Pawny has always use that mechanism since version 0.1 
    and the preliminarily test shows that it plays better with DTC 'ON'.
  - Developed built-in 'epd' function for the 'Strategic Test Suite'ù file format in console mode. 
    The commands are visible trough 'help'.

* Version 0.14
Date started:  17.11.2009
Date released: 04.12.2009

  (Changes and notes)
  - 'ponderhit'ù UCI command's reception - implemented. 
    The lack of it in the previous versions was costing time losses with ponder ON.
  - Added 'Reset_Timer_On_Ponderhit'ù UCI option, which is OFF by default. 
    When the option is ON and the engine receives 'ponderhit' command from the GUI,
    the time for the next move will be allocated again and the search will continue.
  - The 'hashfull'ù command's output is now corrected and 
    displays the amount of saved (or re-written) hash entries during the last search.
  - Small search changes.

* Version 0.13
Date started:  01.10.2009
Date released: 12.10.2009

  (Changes and notes)
  - Board representation changed to 16*16 for better alignment.
  - Developed basic pawn hash table with a lot of room for optimization and improvement.
  - Pawn evaluation code - reorganized to maintain the pawn table.
  - Added some 'trivial draws' recognition - liable to further improvement.
	

* Version 0.12
Date started:  15.09.2009
Date released: 01.10.2009

  (Fixed Bugs)
  - Irrelevant 'info score' with possible value of -INFINITY,
    after the search is completed costs the game result! - fixed.
  - 'ucinewgame' initialize  TT again with unknown size - fixed.
  - Too short history stack - fixed.
  - Too short uci line buffer, causing an exception - fixed.
  - Improperly calculated material gain for move in futility pruning - fixed.
  - History stack improperly indexed in the recapture extension - fixed.

  (Changes and notes)
  - New data structures for move representation.
  - Some work was done on the info output, still more to be done.
  - A lot of code was revised regarding new types and sizes.
  - Better code logic, typecasting and other minor changes.


* Version 0.11
Date started:  03.09.2009
Date released: 15.09.2009

  (Changes and notes)
  - New move generator (entirely rewritten). 
    The board is now represented as 16*14 array, 
    Piece lists - as array of linked lists.
  - Evaluation and Knowledge modules was entirely rewritten regarding the
    new representation. Same for board initialization functions.
    There is NO new chess knowledge added to the evaluation function - only code optimizations!
  - Several other optimizations have been made, again regarding the 16*14 rep.
    (that includes removing the futile 'outside board' checks (during delta attack gen. for example)
    and double memory references for getting piece information).
