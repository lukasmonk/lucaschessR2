instructions explain the settings and usage for the Komodo 12.1.1 chess engine. This is an improvement on the version of Komodo that won the 2017 World Computer Chess Championship (WCCC), the 2017 World Speed Chess Championship, the 2017 TCEC Blitz Championship, and the 2017 World Rapid Chess Championship. Earlier versions beat three strong grandmasters, each by 3 to 1, despite giving them two pawn handicaps in two hour long games.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">NOTE: the most important settings for best strength are Threads and Hash described below.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">NOTE: Komodo is a chess engine. It can be used in any chess GUI that uses UCI (Universal Chess Interface) chess engines. You will find instructions for installing it in the </span><span class="c14">HOW TO RUN</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;section below.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Komodo 12.1.1 is an improvement over all previous Komodo versions. Komodo supports multi-core computers and endgame tablebases. </span><span class="c0">Komodo has won many highly respected engine tournaments multiple times, such as TCEC, CCT, and the World Computer Chess Championship, the World Blitz and the World Rapid championships. Komodo 12.1.1 is about three elo stronger than Komodo 12, our last release, based on our own single-thread testing at various blitz levels, and about forty elo stronger than Komodo 11 at blitz levels, which drops to about thirty elo at levels in the &ldquo;rapid&rdquo; range. In the new MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search) mode, on one thread it is around 3120 on the CCRL 40/4 scale, around 3170 on two threads, and around 3220 on four threads,which we believe makes it the strongest Monte-Carlo engine for the pc and roughly a hundred elo stronger than Komodo 12 MCTS on one thread, more on four. On 12 or more threads, estimated rated is 3300 on CCRL 40/4 scale. While it is not competitive with normal Komodo in strength (so far), it is competitive with it if you set MultiPV to a high number on both, and its playing style and move choices are more like Alpha-Zero than like normal engines, meaning that it is generally less materialistic than normal Komodo, in the style of the spectacular World Champion Mikhail Tal. Also in general the MCTS moves are more human-like and more tricky for humans to meet than normal Komodo. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Komodo 12.1.1 is an improved version of the program that defeated World Champion Candidate and U.S. Champion Hikaru Nakamura by 2.5 to 1.5 despite giving him rook for knight, f2 pawn, f7 pawn, and four move &nbsp;handicaps. There are three important new features in 12.1.1 since Komodo 11, &ldquo;Use MCTS&rdquo;, &ldquo;Skill&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Book Moves&rdquo; all described below. And Komodo now includes a BMI2 compile giving extra speed and elo points for machines that can support it. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Key features of Komodo 12.1.1</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"><br> - Evaluation developed by a Grandmaster</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;- Multi-core support (up to 64 cores)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;- Syzygy endgame tablebase support</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;- BMI2 support for more speed<br> - Improved Monte Carlo Tree Search gives a new chess perspective</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;- Bugfix for some rare timeouts in MCTS search mode</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;- MCTS Explore lowered to 5</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What&#39;s new in Komodo 12.1.1 since Komodo 11.01:</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><ul class="c24 lst-kix_i02x84zfpjz2-0 start"><li class="c1 c5"><span class="c0">New optional Monte Carlo Tree Search</span></li><li class="c1 c5"><span class="c0">Added Skill setting</span></li><li class="c1 c5"><span class="c0">New Book Moves option to limit number of book moves</span></li><li class="c1 c5"><span class="c0">Special compile for BMI2 machines</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">===================</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you have Windows</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">===================</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The executables for Windows are in the /Windows subdirectory in the zip file you received.

Please copy the files from the zip file to a directory on your local hard drive. &nbsp;We recommend making one directory to keep all your komodo files in one place (such as c:\engines), so they are easier to find and add to your chess programs. With the 64bit version, Komodo automatically detects if the special popcount instructions are supported by your CPU and uses then if available to speed it up. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Note: S</span><span class="c0">ome antivirus programs may prevent extracting executable files from zip files.

It calculates moves but does not include a &lsquo;chessboard&rsquo; display. The Komodo web site recommends a few &#39;chessboard&#39; programs (aka Chess GUIs) which can be used with Komodo, some of them are open source and of very high quality. &nbsp;You will find instructions for installing Komodo in many of the most popular GUIs in Windows here:</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&nbsp; (</span><span class="c2"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://komodochess.com/installation.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1528153381068000">http://komodochess.com/installation.htm</a></span><span class="c0">). </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">If you do not already own a good UCI-compliant GUI (such as Fritz, Chessbase, Hiarcs Chess Explorer or the Shredder GUI), a good free one for Windows is Arena (</span><span class="c2"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://playwitharena.com&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1528153381069000">playwitharena.com</a></span><span class="c0">), version 3.0.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Important: For best play it is very important to set the Threads value to match your system. &nbsp;Komodo&#39;s settings can be changed from the GUI. We will explain the non-standard settings below. See setHash.txt for additional information on setting the hash size based on your specific machine and time control.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14 c19">The most important settings to adjust for your computer are Threads and Hash. They are described below.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hash</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">----</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">This defines the maximum amount of memory to use for the transposition table - a major factor in the performance of modern chess programs. The default is set to 192 (in megabytes) which is probably enough for rapid use but should be set higher for longer think times or four or more cores. It is usually safe, but may not be optimum, to use half of your available memory for Hash, but smaller Hash size will improve performance slightly in fast play. &nbsp;See the document setHASH.txt for more specific information on how this should be set for ultimate performance. &nbsp;All 64 bit versions allow up to 65536 megabytes (64 GB) to be allocated, assuming your system has that much. The Windows 32 bit version limits this to 2048 megabytes due to hardware and operating system limitations. Please note Komodo&rsquo;s hash entry size is a bit different from other programs. If you allocate 16 megabytes, Komodo will only use 12, and not use any more until you set it to 24, and so on with each doubling. This is normal. Our scheme has the advantage that on a computer with memory equal to a power of 2 GB, such as 8 or 16 or 32 GB, you can generally use &frac34; of the memory for Hash instead of just half, while still leaving enough for the operating system and other things. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Threads</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">-------</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For best performance it is very important to correctly set the Threads value. The default is 1. You should usually Threads to the number of &quot;real&quot; cores on your machine, except as noted below. Consult your computer manufacturer to determine how many cpu cores your machine has (not to be confused with the number of cpu threads your machine has). We recommend running Komodo with Hyperthreading turned off on your computer, although this is debatable and may depend on your hardware; it is pretty clear that Hyperthreading should be off on machines with many cores, but for machines with no more than four or perhaps six cores it&rsquo;s unclear. You can often find the hyperthreading option in one of the boot up BIOS settings. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you do run with Hyperthreading on (the default on most machines), there is some evidence that running with six threads may be optimum for a four core machine with eight threads. For example, on an i7 with hyperthreading, you typically have 4 &quot;real&quot; cores and 4 hyper-threaded or virtual cores. While the operating system may report 8 cores on this machine, there are only 4 cores and so you set Threads to 4 if Hyperthreading is off or to 6 if it is on. We have run some matches which confirm (subject to statistical error) that 6 Threads does score the best on such a machine with Hyperthreading on. On systems with many cores (say 16 or more), it is probably best not to use more than the number of &ldquo;real&rdquo; cores even with Hyperthreading on. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Note some GUIs, including ChessBase, change the default to the number of cores reported by the operating system, so you might need to change the default value in such cases. &nbsp;If you find your computer to be sluggish or unresponsive when running Komodo, decrease the Threads value by 1. This will free up a thread for use by the operating system, GUI and other programs.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Table Memory</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">------------</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">This parameter determines how much memory, in megabytes, Komodo will allocate to various internal tables such as the pawn structure hash table, evaluation cache and others. &nbsp;These are used by Komodo&rsquo;s evaluation to prevent doing duplicate work. If you allocate too much or too little memory </span><span class="c6 c13">it can negatively impact your performance</span><span class="c0">. &nbsp;The default value of 128 is probably close to optimal for fast play on most machines since 2013 but you may want to experiment with raising this value if you have a high performance machine. For slower games (or analysis) and/or for machines with many cores, higher values are appropriate. We have raised the upper limit in Komodo 9.2 and higher to 1024 megabytes since this may be appropriate for TCEC or similar use with many cores and long time limits. &nbsp;We used 512 in our recent tournament victories. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you have a NUMA machine and you notice the nodes per second in Komodo to start off slowly, you could experiment with making Table Memory 2 or 3 megs per core you use in your system. Limiting the Table Memory to about the size of the cache for each CPU can allow faster access to the data since it would be locally cached instead of being in slower to access main memory. &nbsp;Use a few minutes search and note the nodes per second you get as you try different Table Memory values, then use that setting.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Use LMR</span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c19 c23">Note in MCTS mode, Selectivity is internally set to an optimized value.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c19 c23"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">-------</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">LMR (Late Move Reductions) is a search technique that is designed to aggressively reduce certain moves in the search tree, so greater depths can be obtained. However this can sometimes miss important moves. &nbsp;</span><span class="c17 c6 c13">LMR can be turned &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot;. In general Komodo will play much stronger with LMR turned &quot;on&quot;, but one might want to experiment with turning it off to try a much shallower, but more thorough, search in some positions. With LMR &quot;on&quot; you can make further adjustments using the parameter Reduction described below.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Null Move Pruning</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">-----------------</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Like LM</span><span class="c6">R</span><span class="c0">, this is also a technique to aggressively prune moves from the search tree. &nbsp;Komodo plays much stronger with Null Move Pruning turned ON, but occasionally things can be missed, especially very deep threats and zugzwang positions. &nbsp;This option allows you to experiment in the case that you have a difficult position which cannot be resolved and want to see if a much shallower, but more thorough, search would help.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Overhead ms</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">-----------</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is designed to compensate for slow user interfaces or slow internet connections, where a fraction of a second can be lost in the processing and transferring of information back and forth from the engine to the interface or interface to a chess server. &nbsp;The value is in milliseconds (1/1000th of a second). &nbsp;This should probably be left alone unless you see the program starting to forfeit games due to exhausting its time. If you see such time forfeits, increase this value. The default is 40. For internet play where lag is an issue a value of 60 is a good first try, but may have to go to 100 or even higher if you see time losses. For games with fairly long time control, 50 is a good value for general use just to be safe since the lost time will not be noticeable at these levels. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Contempt (Komodo 9.2 and higher)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">--------------------------------</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A positive Contempt is used by the computer&rsquo;s evaluation to discourage (or encourage if negative) piece trades, blocked pawn structures, and repetition draws early in the game. Contempt has been redefined with version 11.3 and higher; the default value is now 16 which should help against weaker opponents. Against near-equal opponents, set Contempt to 0 for best results. Against a human opponent, Contempt should be at least 40 even if he is the World Champion. Suggested values include 60 against grandmasters, 75 against International masters, 100 against masters, and 150 against strong amateurs. A good rule of thumb is to subtract the opponent&#39;s Elo rating from 3450 (estimated rating of Komodo 12.1.1 on a quadcore machine) and divide by 12. Higher Contempt values are especially appropriate when Komodo is giving a handicap. For handicap play, a good rule of thumb is to set Contempt for half the value of the initial position based on a one minute search in infinite analysis mode from the human&rsquo;s point of view. For example, if giving knight odds, if an initial one minute analysis search shows Komodo as down by 3.5 pawns, set Contempt to 175, which is 175 centipawns, or half of the disadvantage. Contempt works with the next option &ldquo;White Contempt&rdquo;. In analysis mode, Komodo internally sets Contempt to zero unless &ldquo;White Contempt&rdquo; is turned on. Note that Contempt has no effect in MCTS mode. While we may introduce it in the </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Future, the very nature of MCTS makes it act as if a moderate value of Contempt was set. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">White Contempt</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">--------------</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">The &ldquo;White Contempt&rdquo; se</span><span class="c0">tting forces Komodo always to use the Contempt value described above from White&rsquo;s point of view, instead of from whatever side Komodo is searching or analyzing, and also uses Contempt in infinite or analysis mode. If you are playing tournaments with multiple games, this should be turned off since &ldquo;White Contempt&rdquo; &ldquo;locks&rdquo; Contempt to one color instead of for the side Komodo is currently searching. &ldquo;White Contempt&rdquo; is most useful in analyzing positions. &nbsp;A positive value will discourage Komodo playing as White from accepting a draw or trading pieces. A negative Contempt value will encourage Komodo playing as White to trade pieces and seek a draw. &nbsp;For Black, a reversed sign should be used (so a negative value like -10 will discourage Black from exchanging pieces, and a positive value like 10 will encourage Black to seek a draw). </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;White Contempt&rdquo; also prevents Komodo from automatically setting Contempt to zero when running infinite analysis. This helps make anal</span><span class="c0">ysis consistent when switching sides and exploring various lines and lets you include a non-zero Contempt in your analysis. Note when playing against the computer, if you wish to use a non-zero Contempt, &nbsp;either turn off &ldquo;White Contempt&rdquo; so that Contempt will apply to the Computer&rsquo;s side, or you can use the above description to set an appropriate Contempt for the specific side that Komodo is playing. &nbsp;Please note if &ldquo;White Contempt&rdquo; is off, in infinite search or analysis mode, Komodo will always use a value of 0 for Contempt.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Note that Contempt modifies the reported scores. On average a setting of 10 will increase the score for that side by ten centipawns (0.1 in most GUIs) in the opening, much less in the endgame. Contempt is turned off in Infinite analysis unless &ldquo;White Contempt&rdquo; (described below) is used. Note that Contempt has no effect in MCTS mode.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Time Usage</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">----------</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This provides the ability to manipulate Komodo&#39;s time control heuristics, to make it allocate time more quickly or less quickly. &nbsp;The default is 0 which is what we believe is the ideal setting but remains to be tested at longer time controls. &nbsp;You can make it play faster (use less time) by using a negative number or you can make it allocate time more aggressively by setting it to a positive value. &nbsp;The range of values is between -9 and +9. &nbsp;It&#39;s very unlikely extreme values will play well, so we suggest experimenting with relatively modest changes to the default. The ideal value may depend on the time limit.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tablebase (Syzygy) support</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">--------------------------</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Komodo supports Ronald de Man&#39;s &#39;Syzygy&#39; endgame tablebases. Endgame tablebases can be used to provide absolute knowledge about chess positions in which only a few pieces are left on the board (at the time of this writing, the Syzygy bases support up to 6-man positions, including the kings). Adding Syzygy to your computer and Komodo can increase the playing strength.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Syzygy tablebases are &quot;Distance to Zero&quot; (DTZ) tablebases. This means that they report, in addition to a definitive win/draw/loss (WDL) score, the distance to the zeroing of the 50-move draw clock. Unlike other endgame tablebases which report Distance to Mate (DTM), the Syzygy bases won&#39;t always report the fastest win from a particular endgame position, but you can be confident that the WDL score (and moves) provided by a tablebase probe are accurate.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How to get the Syzygy tablebases: at the moment, the best way to get the required files is via the file-sharing service BitTorrent (on OSX, Transmission is a good client, on Windows and Linux, Vuze). &nbsp;The necessary .torrent files can be found at http://oics.olympuschess.com/tracker/index.php. You should get at least the 3-4-5-man set (approx. 2 GB). The 6-man set is an additional approx. 138 GB large and will take a while to download. The 3-4-5-man set is also available for direct download from:</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">http://chess.cygnitec.com/tablebases/syzygy/.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Installing the Syzygy tablebases: create a folder on your computer&#39;s hard drive and place the fully-downloaded .rtbw (WDL files) and .rtbz (DTZ files) in it. If you have an SSD drive, we recommend that you place the WDL files in a folder on that drive, especially if you are using the 6-man bases.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Understanding the Syzygy tablebase output: if the number of pieces on the board is less than or equal to the &#39;Syzygy Probe Limit&#39; [see below] or the number of pieces supported by your installation of the Syzygy bases, whichever is less, Komodo will report a score which can be interpreted as a win, draw or loss.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A score of +/- #1000 indicates a tablebase win or loss for a root tablebase position, that is, for a 6-man position with 6-man tablebases installed. For tablebase wins or losses which are determined during search, for instance for a 6-man position with 5-man tablebases installed, Komodo will return +/- 250.00 respectively. Komodo will attempt to resolve these scores to actual mate scores, although this may take a long time. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Finally, a score of 0.00 or +/- 0.02 indicates a draw (+/- 0.02 is a draw which would be a win/loss if the 50-move rule were not in effect).</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Syzygy tablebase options: Komodo has a number of UCI options to control its use of the tablebases.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Use Syzygy: when on (default), Komodo will try to use the Syzygy tablebases specified in the &#39;SyzygyPath&#39; option (see below). When off, Komodo will not attempt to load the bases.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">SyzygyPath: this defines an absolute path on your computer to the tablebase files. On Windows, multiple paths can be separated with a semicolon (;) character. On OSX and Linux, multiple paths should be separated with the colon (:) character.

Of course, if you have only the 3-4-5-man set, Komodo will only begin probing the bases when a 5-man position arises. Note 6 piece use can take up both a lot of drive storage,and RAM during the search.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Syzygy 50 Move Rule: when on (default), Komodo will respect the 50-move rule in its tablebase evaluation (a won position which requires more than 50 moves without a pawn move or capture to win will be scored as a draw). &nbsp;When off, Komodo will ignore the 50-move rule in its evaluation (the same position would receive a winning score).</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Smart Syzygy: When this is checked/on, Komodo will always check Syzygy TBs for (Syzygy Probe Limit - 1) pieces and under at all depths in the main search. Otherwise, it will only consult Syzygy when the Probe Depth and Probe Limit conditions are met. This feature is designed to allow Syzygy access from slower hard drives. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For instance, set Syzygy Probe Limit to 6 (the default if you have the 6-man tablebase files), Probe Depth to 10 and enable Smart Syzygy. At search depth 10 and higher, Komodo will use Syzygy for 6-piece positions. At lower search depths, it will only consult Syzygy when there are 5 pieces or fewer on the board. You can adjust Probe Depth to see what gives you the best results. Note that the 5-piece Syzygy tablebases used during search take up about 0.5 GB, which the operating system will cache in memory. 6-piece tablebase access will generally cause slowdowns when using standard hard drives. Smart Syzygy has no effect at the starting position of a search (if 6 pieces are on the board, the 6-piece tablebases will be consulted if Probe Limit is 6).</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Selectivity</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">-----------</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You can adjust how aggressively Komodo prunes using the &quot;Selectivity&quot; parameter. &nbsp;Higher values will encourage Komodo to prune more at low search depths, leading to a deeper overall search at an increasing risk of missing some moves. &nbsp;The default in Komodo 12.1.1 is 130. A setting of 250 will set selectivity to the maximum. Note in MCTS mode, Selectivity is internally set to an optimized value.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Reduction</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">---------</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This controls how deeply Komodo searches. &nbsp;Higher &quot;Reduction&quot; values will cause Komodo to reduce parts of the tree more, increasing overall search depth but possibly missing some good lines. &nbsp;The default is 0. We are fairly confident that the best value on a single thread is close to zero, but we have not yet determined whether other values may be better on many threads, so feel free to experiment. &nbsp;Note in MCTS mode, Reduction is internally set to an optimized value.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">King Safety</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">-----------</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This controls how highly Komodo scores king safety. &nbsp;The higher the value, the greater the effects of attacks on the king in Komodo&#39;s evaluation. &nbsp;The default is 70 in Komodo 12.1.1. Note in MCTS mode, King Safety is internally set to an optimized value.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Persistent Hash</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">---------------</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is useful for long analysis. &nbsp;It allows you to save the current Hash Table to your hard drive, then reload it later. &nbsp;First, set a name for the file in the &quot;Hash File Name&quot; option. Most GUIs will require you to close the dialog box with an OK to &ldquo;set&rdquo; the name. You should then stop the search/analysis, return to the UCI parameters then, then click the &quot;Save Hash to File&quot; button. &nbsp;To later reload the saved information, first make sure the &quot;Hash File Name&quot; is for the file you want, then click &quot;Load Hash from File&quot;. &nbsp;Once it loads, you may continue analysis. &nbsp;You must make sure the current hash filename is the same as what was used when you saved the file. &nbsp;Note that hash files can be very large and can take a lot of time to save and load, so make sure you have enough disk space to use them.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Minimal Reporting</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">-----------------</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">This feature allows you to reduce the data Komodo outputs for the first X ply of a search. The default value of 0 does not suppress any program output. &nbsp;Value of 1 or more will suppress outputting the current move Komodo is searching. Higher numbers will suppress more output. For example, with a value of 8 Komodo will not print move sequences or scores for the first 8 ply. This can save on communication overhead with the GUI and is useful when Komodo is running over a network connection or is playing at fast time controls. The default value is 0, meaning all data is reported and nothing is suppressed.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dynamism</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">--------</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Introduced in Komodo 9.4, Dynamism lets you control how important Komodo thinks the dynamic part of the evaluation is. The default is 140. &nbsp;Values under 140 reduce the dynamic evaluation, while values above 140 increase the dynamic evaluation. &nbsp;Lower values will make Komodo play more conservatively, while with higher values it will play riskier moves. More static parts of the evaluation like material and pawn structure are not changed by Dynamism. Although the parameter can be set from 0 to 400, single-digit values will cause bizarre play. A value around 80 will in general produce more realistic evaluations than the default 140, although it will weaken play by 20 to 30 Elo points. The maximum Dynamism value was raised at the request of a Komodo user for version 11.01 and newer. Higher values seem to help in problem sets but not in practical play. Note in MCTS mode, Dynamism is internally set to an optimized value.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Progress Threshold</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">------------------</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Progress Threshold allows you to set the number of half moves played with no capture or pawn advance (per the 50 move rule) where Komodo starts pulling the evaluation score towards zero. We used 85 until mid-2016, then reduced it to 30 for later versions, which probably cost one or two elo but made Komodo a better analysis tool and shortens long clearly drawn endgames. The lower this value the sooner Komodo will start to see that no progress is being made and encourage it to take another line. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Variety</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">-------</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Variety lets you have Komodo play different lines from its default. A value of zero turns off Variety. With the setting at zero, Komodo will always play the best move it can find. A number from 1-20 allows Komodo to find different moves in some positions. The higher the number, the greater the variety of moves will be. Higher values should lower elo, although we could not detect any elo loss (tiny gain actually) after many thousands of ultra-fast games with a setting of 5 or 10, and less than one elo loss with the maximum setting of 20, with a three elo error margin in each case. Perhaps it was a bit lucky; but it seems that the weakening is not more than one elo per five points set, probably less. Note that when still in Opening Book (described below), the book determines what moves will be played.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Note that running Komodo on more than one thread automatically produces variety, even at the same depth, but the Variety option works even on one thread, and should increase variety on multi-threads. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Skill</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">-----</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You can use Skill to make Komodo weaker, to better match your playing strength. The default setting of 20 makes Komodo run at full strength. When Skill is set below 20, Komodo limits its search depth and modifies its evaluation for weaker play. Komodo should move almost instantly on all levels below 20, and the strength of its play should be almost independent of hardware (except at level 20). The lower the Skill setting, the weaker Komodo becomes. &nbsp;Komodo will drop about 150 elo for each point drop in Skill below 19. Our intention is that for quick games even a virtual beginner (say Elo 200) should be fairly matched with level 0, while the World Champion should have a tough time with level 19 (est. 2900), but there has not yet been enough testing to say how realistic these numbers are. If the human is treating the games like serious tournament games (say 2 hours long) then the corresponding elo values would be a few hundred lower. Skill also limits Komodo&rsquo;s use of the opening book. Levels 0, 1 and 2 will not use the opening book. Level 3 will only use the book for one move. Each level above this will use one more move for each side of the opening book. Note that this refers only to &ldquo;own book&rdquo;, so any outside opening book should be turned off for this book depth feature to work properly. Also note that &ldquo;Threads&rdquo; are assumed to be set to 1 (for all levels below 20). If you set Threads for a higher value, it will play stronger than its intended level by something like 20 elo for two threads, 40 elo for four, 60 elo for 8, and 80 elo for 16 threads, although the precise amount depends on the level in question. So if you have a quad core machine with 8 threads, and you find that (for example) level 10 is too easy for you but level 11 is too difficult, you could try level 10 with Threads set to 4 or even 7 or 8 to get an intermediate level. Note that &ldquo;skill&rdquo; does not work properly with MCTS.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monte Carlo Tree Search and MCTS Explore</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">----------------------------------------</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Komodo 12 adds a form of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). This is similar to what is used in programs like AlphaZero Chess. &nbsp;MCTS is different from traditional chess engine search techniques in that the search is guided by win probabilities instead of a traditional alpha-beta search and evaluation. The result is a more human-like way of playing, since humans, like MCTS, are normally concerned with what move will give them the best chance to win (or draw if in inferior position) against an imperfect opponent, not what move is best against perfect play, which is what alpha-beta search tries to do. MCTS often gives very different move choices than normal Komodo. The Komodo system is a hybrid. When Use_MCTS is on, Komodo will use Monte Carlo Tree Search unless it is way ahead, enough to justify resignation (win probability more than 99.9%). In that case, Komodo switches to its traditional search scheme to &ldquo;mop up&rdquo; the game more quickly. &nbsp;The MCTS is experimental and in its infancy. You turn on MCTS by checking &ldquo;Use MCTS&rdquo; in the UCI parameters of your chess GUI.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monte Carlo Tree search requires extra memory, so might not be suitable for machines with very little memory. Once the Monte Carlo move tree is full, the search will simply complete, even if the allocated time has not been reached. This will happen when the number of MC nodes exceeds the current limit (a little above 8 million nodes). On a single core this is enough to search for over 2 hours, less when more cores are used. If you wish to analyze for long periods of time on a many core machine, you can increase the size of the Monte Carlo tree in memory by raising the MCTS Hash value. A rough estimate on current (2018) processors is each core can expand about 1000 Monte Carlo nodes a second. Each node is 40 bytes. So it you wanted to analyze with say 8 cores for 5 hours, you should set MCTS Hash to 1000 x 40 x 8 x 3600 (secs in an hour)/ 1000000 = 5760 megs. The sum of MCTS Hash plus regular Hash should not exceed the maximum value you have found to work well for regular Hash in normal mode. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In MCTS, search is controlled by the rate of exploration (searching a wider tree and adding more variations) and exploitation (extending existing lines to see deeper). You can adjust this with the MCTS Explore parameter which has a default of 5. The higher MCTS Explore is, the more exploration Komodo uses.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Note that MCTS is not like a traditional search where depth is increasing and reported as a new iteration is completed. &nbsp;Instead, best move choices are update once every 3 seconds, &nbsp;so it can appear some depths are skipped over. Since most GUIs want to see a depth output, Komodo estimates the depth based on MCTS nodes searched. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One nice feature about MCTS is that Multi-PV is essentially &ldquo;free&rdquo;. &nbsp;With use_MCTS off, when Komodo performs a non-MCTS search, each additional MultiPV move takes additional time. But in MCTS mode, the move tree is saved as winning probabilities for all root moves. One note: since MCTS does not increment depth ply by ply, depth commands are not so useful. The displayed depth is an estimate based on the current tree number of nodes. MCTS should be used with timed play and not fixed depth. Also note MCTS takes some time to build a useful tree, and will not play well (for a 3000 rated engine) at time limits averaging less than four seconds per move. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Currently MCTS mode does not use more than 12 cores, so if you set a higher number it will just use 12. We hope to be able to remove this limitation in the near future. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Note that the eval is displayed in the traditional centipawn format, but it is really a win probability converted to a centipawn score. This is done so that GUIs which expect a traditional score will work properly. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Note that many of the UCI options, such as Reduction, S</span><span class="c6 c13">electivi</span><span class="c0">ty, King Safety, and Dynamism, won&rsquo;t do anything in MCTS mode, because MCTS search doesn&rsquo;t use the values you see there. The &ldquo;Ponder&rdquo; option does work properly. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Note to testers: We recommend that the MCTS option not be tested at any time limit faster than three minutes plus one second, or the equivalent. MCTS mode needs some time to produce a tree with enough depth to play well. We encourage tests on four (or even up to 12) threads, as we believe Komodo MCTS gains more than most normal engines from using multiple threads. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Opening Books</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">-------------</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Komodo can use Polyglot opening books.

You can find more Polyglot opening books on the internet.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Komodo&rsquo;s default book name is komodo.bin, which is what the free book above is named. So after downloading it, open the ZIP file and copy the komodo.bin book to the same directory you put the your komodo executable in. Also, make sure the OwnBook UCI </span><span class="c6 c13">option is checked, and that &quot;Book File&quot; is also set to komodo.bin. The option &ldquo;Best Book Line&rdquo; when set will make Komodo always play the best scoring book move, or randomly select between two or more book moves with the same score. When off, it will tend to play the best scoring move more often, but still give the weaker moves some play for more variety. &nbsp;Komodo 9.4 and up better handle opening books modified using the free scid program (</span><span class="c2 c13"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sourceforge.net/projects/scid/files/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1528153381086000">https://sourceforge.net/projects/scid/files/</a></span><span class="c0 c13">).
