I think Pawn Shielding, King safety, and tropism can all be tuned for better results. 
To turn off Lazy Eval set Chess knowledge to 500.  If you have any suggestions for piece square tables please email them to me. 
I plan on giving many piece square tables to choose from for each piece in UCI options in future releases.
For bitbases please go to the Scorpion download section at http://wbec-ridderkerk.nl/index.html
Put the bitbases in the egbb folder and make sure you have the egbbdll.dll in the folder with the bitbases.
For an opening book goto http://chessbazaar.mlweb.info/fruitbooks
