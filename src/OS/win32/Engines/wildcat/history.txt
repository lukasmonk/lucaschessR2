WildCat 5:
----------
2.08.2005

- Razoring at depth == 1	
- Futility pruning at depth == 1
- Checks time 10 times per second during search. Before time was checked every 64 KNodes. It cause problems in late endgame with big egtb installed, because speed fall to ~5 KNodes / second. As a result time checks interval above 10 seconds. This can cause time loses.
- many small tweaks in evaluation
- don't move instantly when received draw offer
